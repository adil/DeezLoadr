PLEASE CREATE A SEPERATE ISSUE FOR EVERY BUG / ENHANCEMENT!

Before creating an issue:
- Check if you haven't changed anything at the code by yourself
- Check if you have the latest version of the app
- Check if there is already a similar issue

What to describe in your issue:
- Your operating system and architecture used (Windows x64, Linux x86,...)
- What you have done exactly (so I can test it myself too)
- Maybe if you know what the problem could be :)

PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THIS! I WILL BE ABLE TO FIX THE BUG FASTER :)
